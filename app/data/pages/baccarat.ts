    <h2>Introduction to Baccarat</h2>
    <p>Baccarat is an elegant card game that's simple to play yet offers sophisticated betting options. The goal is to bet on either the Player's hand or the Banker's hand to get closest to 9.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cards 2-9 are worth their face value</li>
      <li>10s and face cards are worth 0</li>
      <li>Aces are worth 1</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Flow</h2>
    <p>Here's how a typical baccarat game plays out:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Players bet on either Player, Banker, or Tie</li>
      <li>Two cards are dealt to both Player and Banker</li>
      <li>If either hand totals 8 or 9, it's a "natural" win</li>
      <li>Otherwise, drawing rules determine if a third card is taken</li>
    </ol>
